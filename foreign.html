                <p>The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.</p>
                <p>“News?” asked the taller of the two.</p>
                <p>“The best,” replied Severus Snape.</p>
                <p>The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, nearty manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.</p>
                <p>“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging tress broke the moonlight. “It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You should confident that your reception will be good?”</p>
                <p>Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.</p>

                <p>달빛이 드는 좁은 길에서 두 남자가 몇 미터 간격을 두고 갑작스레 나타났다. 그들은 잠깐 동안 가만히 서서 서로의 가슴에 마법 지팡이를 겨눴다. 하지만 곧 서로를 알아보고 마법 지팡이를 망토 속에 집어넣은 다음 같은 방향으로 바쁘게 걷기 시작했다.</p>
                <p>"새로운 소식 있나?" 둘 중 키 큰 사람이 물었다.</p>
                <p>"최고의 소식이 있지." 세베루스 스네이프가 대답했다.</p>
                <p>좁은 길에서 왼쪽에는 나지막한 야생 찔레꽃 덤불이 줄지어 있고, 오른쪽에는 깔끔하게 손질된 산울타리가 높이 솟아 있었다. 성큼성큼 걷는 남자들의 발목 근처에서 긴 망토자락이 펄럭였다.</p>
                <p>"늦었을 수도 있다고 생각했는데." 약슬리가 말했다. 늘어진 나뭇가지들이 달빛을 가릴 때마다 그의 우락부락한 얼굴이 나타났다 사라졌다 했다. "생각했던 것보다 까다로웠지만 그분께서 만족하셨으면 좋겠군. 자네는 환영받을 자신이 있나 보지?"</p>
                <p>스네이프는 고개만 까닥일 뿐 설명을 덧붙이지는 않았다. 그들은 오른쪽에 있는 넓은 진입로로 방향을 틀었다. 길을 따라 구부러지는높다란 산울타리는 남자들의 길을 막아선 위압적인 질문을 지나 멀리까지 이어졌다. 둘은 걸음을 멈추지 않고 경례하듯 조용히 왼팔을 들더니 어두운 철문이 연기로 만들어진 것이라도 되는 양 곧장 통과했다.</p>

            <div class="foreignText">
                <p>The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men's footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right; Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion's head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.</p>
                <p>“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks . . . ” Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort.</p>
                <p>A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.</p>
                <p>The hallway was large, dimly light, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.</p>
                <p>The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room's usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls.</p>
